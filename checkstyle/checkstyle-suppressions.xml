    API javadocs (including descriptors) may reference classes (using '{@link <className>}') which
    aren't directly used in the API class. In order to help the API javadoc look cleaner, we can use
    the simple class name in the javadoc and then import that class. However, for non-API code, we
    want checkstyle prevent an import just for documentation purposes. The
    "preventJavadocUnusedImports" id includes processing of javadocs when checking unused imports.
    We will apply that to the API classes only.
