/**
 *  Conventions:
 *
 *  Implementations shall report UNRECOVERABLE EXCEPTIONS by throwing
 *  ExecutionExceptions, though SqlExecutor doesn't enforce this by as we don't believe in
 *  Java checked exceptions. Report errors by returning values as indicated by each
 *  function and preparing for the subsequent getErrorMsg call.
 *
 *  Each execution (both query and non-query shall return an non-negative execution ID(execId).
 *  Negative execution IDs are reserved for error handling.
 *
 *  User shall be able to query the status of an execution even after it's finished, so the
 *  executor shall keep record of all the execution unless being asked to remove them (
 *  when removeExecution is called.)
 *
 * IMPORTANT: An executor shall support two ways of supplying data:
 * 1. Say user selects profiles of users who visited LinkedIn in the last 5 mins. There could
 *    be millions of rows, but the UI only need to show a small fraction. That's retrieveQueryResult,
 *    accepting a row range (startRow and endRow). Note that UI may ask for the same data over and over,
 *    like when user switches from page 1 to page 2 and data stream changes at the same time, the two
 *    pages may actually have overlapped or even same data.
 *
 * 2. Say user wants to see clicks on a LinkedIn page of certain person from now on. In this mode
 *    consumeQueryResult shall be used. UI can keep asking for new rows, and once the rows are consumed,
 *    it's no longer necessary for the executor to keep them. If lots of rows come in, the UI may be only
 *    interested in the last certain rows (as it's in a logview mode), so all data older can be dropped.
