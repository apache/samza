/**
 * Group a set of SystemStreamPartitions into logical taskNames that share a common characteristic, defined
 * by the implementation.  Each taskName has a key that uniquely describes what sets may be in it, but does
 * not generally enumerate the elements of those sets.  For example, a SystemStreamPartitionGrouper that
 * groups SystemStreamPartitions (each with 4 partitions) by their partition, would end up generating
 * four TaskNames: 0, 1, 2, 3.  These TaskNames describe the partitions but do not list all of the
 * SystemStreamPartitions, which allows new SystemStreamPartitions to be added later without changing
 * the definition of the TaskNames, assuming these new SystemStreamPartitions do not have more than
 * four partitions.  On the other hand, a SystemStreamPartitionGrouper that wanted each SystemStreamPartition
 * to be its own, unique group would use the SystemStreamPartition's entire description to generate
 * the TaskNames.
