/**
 * A {@link Table} is an abstraction for data sources that support random access by key. It is an evolution of the
 * existing {@link KeyValueStore} API. It offers support for both local and remote data sources and composition through
 * hybrid tables. For remote data sources, a {@code RemoteTable} provides optimized access with caching, rate-limiting,
 * and retry support.
 * <p>
 * Depending on the implementation, a {@link Table} can be a {@link ReadableTable} or a {@link ReadWriteTable}.
 * <p>
 * Use a {@link TableDescriptor} to specify the properties of a {@link Table}. For High Level API
 * {@link StreamApplication}s, use {@link StreamApplicationDescriptor#getTable} to obtain the {@link Table} instance for
 * the descriptor that can be used with the {@link MessageStream} operators like {@link MessageStream#sendTo(Table)}.
 * Alternatively, use {@link TaskContext#getTable(String)} in {@link InitableFunction#init} to get the table instance
 * for use within operator functions. For Low Level API {@link TaskApplication}s, use {@link TaskContext#getTable}
 * in {@link InitableTask#init} to get the table instance for use within the Task.
 *
 * @param <R> the type of records in the table
