/**
 * BootstrappingChooser is a composable MessageChooser that only chooses
 * an envelope when it's received at least one envelope for each SystemStream.
 * It does this by only allowing wrapped.choose to be called when the wrapped
 * MessageChooser has been updated with at least one envelope for every
 * SystemStream defined in the latestMessageOffsets map. Thus, the guarantee
 * is that the wrapped chooser will have an envelope from each SystemStream
 * whenever it has to make a choice about which envelope to process next.
 *
 * This behavior continues for each SystemStream that has lagging partitions.
 * As a SystemStream catches up to head, it is no longer marked as lagging,
 * and the requirement that the wrapped chooser have an envelope from the
 * SystemStream is dropped. Once all SystemStreams have caught up, this
 * MessageChooser just becomes a pass-through that always delegates to the
 * wrapped chooser.
 *
 * If a SystemStream falls behind after the initial catch-up, this chooser
 * makes no effort to catch the SystemStream back up, again.

   * Checks to see if a bootstrap stream is fully caught up. If it is, the
   * state of the bootstrap chooser is updated to remove the system stream
   * from the set of lagging system streams.
   *
   * A SystemStreamPartition can be deemed "caught up" in one of two ways.
   * First, if a SystemStreamPartition is registered with a starting offset
   * that's equal to the upcoming offset for the SystemStreamPartition, then
   * it's "caught up". For example, if a SystemStreamPartition were registered
   * to start reading from offset 7, and the upcoming offset for the
   * SystemStreamPartition is also 7, then all prior messages are assumed to
   * already have been chosen, and the stream is marked as bootstrapped.
   * Second, if the offset for a chosen message equals the newest offset for the
   * message's SystemStreamPartition, then that SystemStreamPartition is deemed
   * caught up, because all messages in the stream up to the "newest" message
   * have been chosen.
   *
   * Note that the definition of "caught up" here is defined to be when all
   * messages that existed at container start time have been processed. If a
   * SystemStreamPartition's newest message offset is 8 at the time that a
   * container starts, but two more messages are written to the
   * SystemStreamPartition while the container is bootstrapping, the
   * SystemStreamPartition is marked as bootstrapped when the message with
   * offset 8 is chosen, not when the message with offset 10 is chosen.
   *
   * @param systemStreamPartition The SystemStreamPartition to check.
   * @param offset The offset of the most recently chosen message.
   * @param offsetType Whether to check the offset against the newest or
   *                   upcoming offset for the SystemStreamPartition.
   *                   Upcoming is useful during the registration phase,
   *                   and newest is useful during the choosing phase.
