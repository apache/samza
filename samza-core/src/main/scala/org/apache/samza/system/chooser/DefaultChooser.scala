/**
 * DefaultChooser adds additional functionality to an existing MessageChooser.
 *
 * The following behaviors are currently supported:
 *
 * 1. Batching.
 * 2. Prioritized streams.
 * 3. Bootstrapping.
 *
 * By default, this chooser will not do any of this. It will simply default to
 * a RoundRobinChooser.
 *
 * To activate batching, you must define:
 *
 *   task.consumer.batch.size
 *
 * To define a priority for a stream, you must define:
 *
 *   systems.<system>.streams.<stream>.samza.priority
 *
 * To declare a bootstrap stream, you must define:
 *
 *   systems.<system>.streams.<stream>.samza.bootstrap
 *
 * When batching is activated, the DefaultChooserFactory will allow the
 * initial strategy to be executed once (by default, this is RoundRobin). It
 * will then keep picking the SystemStreamPartition that the RoundRobin
 * chooser selected, up to the batch size, provided that there are messages
 * available for this SystemStreamPartition. If the batch size is reached, or
 * there are no messages available, the RoundRobinChooser will be executed
 * again, and the batching process will repeat itself.
 *
 * When a stream is defined with a priority, it is preferred over all lower
 * priority streams in cases where there are messages available from both
 * streams. If two envelopes exist for two SystemStreamPartitions that have
 * the same priority, the default strategy is used to determine which envelope
 * to use (RoundRobinChooser, by default). If a stream doesn't have a
 * configured priority, its priority is 0. Higher priority streams are
 * preferred over lower priority streams.
 *
 * When a stream is defined as a bootstrap stream, it is prioritized with a
 * default priority of Int.MaxValue. This priority can be overridden using the
 * same priority configuration defined above (task.chooser.priorites.*). The
 * DefaultChooserFactory guarantees that the wrapped MessageChooser will have
 * at least one envelope from each bootstrap stream whenever the wrapped
 * MessageChooser must make a decision about which envelope to process next.
 * If a stream is defined as a bootstrap stream, and is prioritized higher
 * than all other streams, it means that all messages in the stream will be
 * processed (up to head) before any other messages are processed. Once all of
 * a bootstrap stream's partitions catch up to head, the stream is marked as
 * fully bootstrapped, and it is then treated like a normal prioritized stream.
 *
 * Valid configurations include:
 *
 *   task.consumer.batch.size=100
 *
 * This configuration will just batch up to 100 messages from each
 * SystemStreamPartition. It will use a RoundRobinChooser whenever it needs to
 * find the next SystemStreamPartition to batch.
 *
 *   systems.kafka.streams.mystream.samza.priority=1
 *
 * This configuration will prefer messages from kafka.mystream over any other
 * input streams (since other input streams will default to priority 0).
 *
 *   systems.kafka.streams.profiles.samza.bootstrap=true
 *
 * This configuration will process all messages from kafka.profiles up to the
 * current head of the profiles stream before any other messages are processed.
 * From then on, the profiles stream will be preferred over any other stream in
 * cases where incoming envelopes are ready to be processed from it.
 *
 *   task.consumer.batch.size=100
 *   systems.kafka.streams.profiles.samza.bootstrap=true
 *   systems.kafka.streams.mystream.samza.priority=1
 *
 * This configuration will read all messages from kafka.profiles from the last
 * checkpointed offset, up to head. It will then prefer messages from profiles
 * over mystream, and prefer messages from mystream over any other stream. In
 * cases where there is more than one envelope available with the same priority
 * (e.g. two envelopes from different partitions in the profiles stream),
 * RoundRobinChooser will be used to break the tie. Once the tie is broken, up
 * to 100 messages will be read from the envelope's SystemStreamPartition,
 * before RoundRobinChooser is consulted again to break the next tie.
 *
 *   systems.kafka.streams.profiles.samza.bootstrap=true
 *   systems.kafka.streams.profiles.samza.reset.offset=true
 *
 * This configuration will bootstrap the profiles stream the same way as the
 * last example, except that it will always start from offset zero, which means
 * that it will always read all messages in the topic from oldest to newest.
