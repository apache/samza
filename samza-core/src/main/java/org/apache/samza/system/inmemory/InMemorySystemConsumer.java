   *          A set of SystemStreamPartition to poll for new messages. If

   *          SystemStreamPartitions, but they are not in the

   * @param timeout
   *          If timeout &lt; 0, poll will block unless all SystemStreamPartition
   *          are at "head" (the underlying system has been checked, and
   *          returned an empty set). If at head, an empty map is returned. If
   *          timeout &gt;= 0, poll will return any messages that are currently
   *          available for any of the SystemStreamPartitions specified. If no
   *          new messages are available, it will wait up to timeout
   *          milliseconds for messages from any SystemStreamPartition to become
   *          available. It will return an empty map if the timeout is hit, and
   *          no new messages are available.
   * @return A map from SystemStreamPartitions to any available
   *         IncomingMessageEnvelopes for the SystemStreamPartitions. If no
   *         messages are available for a SystemStreamPartition that was
   *         supplied in the polling set, the map will not contain a key for the
   *         SystemStreamPartition. Will return an empty map, not null, if no
   *         new messages are available for any SystemStreamPartitions in the
   *         input set.
