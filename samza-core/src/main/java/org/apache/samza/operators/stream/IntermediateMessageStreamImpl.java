/**
 * An intermediate stream is both an input and an output stream (e.g. a repartitioned stream).

 * This implementation accepts a pair of {@link InputOperatorSpec} and {@link OutputStreamImpl} associated
 * with the same logical {@code streamId}. It provides access to its {@link OutputStreamImpl} for
 * the partitionBy operator to send messages out to. It's also a {@link MessageStreamImpl} with
 * {@link InputOperatorSpec} as its operator spec, so that further operations can be chained on the
 * {@link InputOperatorSpec}.
