# Introduction

Samza Table API is an abstraction for data sources that support random 
access by key, which simplifies stream-table-join. It is the natural 
evolution of the existing [storage API] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-kv/src/main/scala/org/apache/samza/storage/kv/KeyValueStorageEngine.scala), 
and it offers support for both local and remote data sources and 
composition through hybrid tables.

For various reasons, a real-time stream often only contain minimal or a 
small amount of information, and may need to be augmented with richer 
information fetched from adjunct data sources through joining. This is 
quite common in advertising, relevance ranking, fraud detection, and 
other domains. However, there exists a wide variety of data stores with 
different characteristics and levels of sophistication. Samza Table API 
simplifies the application developer experience by hiding the details of 
individual technologies, while making it easier to migrate from one 
technology to another.

For remote data sources, the Samza remote table provides optimized access 
such as caching, rate-limiting, retry and batching (future) support.

In addition, more advanced functionalities can be provided through table 
composition. For example, bootstrapping a stream is often used to build 
an authoritative local cache, and today stream processing has to wait 
until bootstrap is completed. A hybrid table can provide access to remote 
data source while the local cache is being built, so that stream processing 
could begin earlier.

Application developers can now take advantage of the aforementioned benefits, 
which are all encapsulated under the Samza Table API.

# Sample Applications

Sample applications demonstrating how to use Samza Table API can be found 
[here] (https://github.com/apache/samza-hello-samza/tree/latest/src/main/java/samza/examples/cookbook).

# Architecture and Concepts

The diagram below illustrates the overall architecture of Samza Table API. 

![diagram-medium](/img/{{site.version}}/learn/documentation/api/table-api-arch.svg)

Let’s look at a few concepts before diving into the API.

![diagram-medium](/img/{{site.version}}/learn/documentation/api/table-class-diagram.svg)

[`Table`] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-api/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/table/Table.java) - 
This interface represents a dataset that can be accessed by key. We support 
two types of tables: read-only and read-write. A table can be accessed either 
synchronously or asynchronously and a request may contain one or more keys. 
There are three broad categories of tables: local, remote and hybrid.

[`ReadableTable`] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-api/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/table/ReadableTable.java) - 
Interface that represents a read-only table. It implements Table.

[`ReadWriteTable`] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-api/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/table/ReadWriteTable.java) - 
Interface that represents a read-write table. It implements Table.

[`TableDescriptor`] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-api/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/operators/TableDescriptor.java) - 
User-facing object that contains metadata that completely describes a table. 
It may include identifier, serialization, provider, configuration, etc. 
Example implementations of this interface are

* [`RemoteTableDescriptor`] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-core/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/table/remote/RemoteTableDescriptor.java) 
 facilitates access to remotely stored data, 
* [`InMemoryTableDescriptor`] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-kv-inmemory/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/storage/kv/inmemory/InMemoryTableDescriptor.java) 
 describes a table stored in-memory, and 
* [`RocksDbTableDescriptor`] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-kv-rocksdb/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/storage/kv/RocksDbTableDescriptor.java) 
 describes a table stored in RocksDB.

# Table Sync and Async API

Samza Table supports both synchronous and asynchronous API. Below is an example for 
the **`get`** operation.

{% highlight java %}
 /**
   * Gets the value associated with the specified {@code key}.
   *
   * @param key the key with which the associated value is to be fetched.
   * @return if found, the value associated with the specified {@code key}; 
   * otherwise, {@code null}.
   * @throws NullPointerException if the specified {@code key} is {@code null}.
   */
  V get(K key);

 /**
   * Asynchronously gets the value associated with the specified {@code key}.
   *
   * @param key the key with which the associated value is to be fetched.
   * @return completableFuture for the requested value
   * @throws NullPointerException if the specified {@code key} is {@code null}.
   */
  CompletableFuture<V> getAsync(K key);
{% endhighlight %}


# Using Table with Samza High Level API

The code snippet below illustrates the usage of table in Samza high level API.

{% highlight java %}
 1  class SamzaStreamApplication implements StreamApplication {
 2    @Override
 3    public void describe(StreamApplicationDescriptor appDesc) {
 4      TableDescriptor<Integer, Profile> desc = new InMemoryTableDescriptor(
 5          "t1", KVSerde.of(new IntegerSerde(), new ProfileJsonSerde()));
 6 
 7      Table<KV<Integer, Profile>> table = appDesc.getTable(desc);
 8 
 9      appDesc.getInputStream("PageView", new NoOpSerde<PageView>())
10          .map(new MyMapFunc())
11          .join(table, new MyJoinFunc())
12          .sendTo(anotherTable);
13    }
14  }
15
16  static class MyMapFunc implements MapFunction<PageView, KV<Integer, PageView>> {
17    private ReadableTable<Integer, Profile> profileTable;
18
19    @Override
20    public void init(Config config, TaskContext context) {
21      profileTable = (ReadableTable<Integer, Profile>) context.getTable("t1");
22    }
23 
24    @Override
25    public KV<Integer, PageView> apply(PageView message) {
26      return new KV.of(message.getId(), message);
27    }
28  }
29
30  static class MyJoinFunc implements StreamTableJoinFunction
31      <Integer, KV<Integer, PageView>, KV<Integer, Profile>, EnrichedPageView> {
32
33    @Override
34    public EnrichedPageView apply(KV<Integer, PageView> m, KV<Integer, Profile> r) {
35      counterPerJoinFn.get(this.currentSeqNo).incrementAndGet();
36        return r == null ? null : new EnrichedPageView(
37            m.getValue().getPageKey(), m.getKey(), r.getValue().getCompany());
38    }
39  }
{% endhighlight %}

In the code snippet above, we read from an input stream, perform transformation, 
join with a table and finally write the output to another table.

1. Line 4-5: A `TableDescriptor` for an in-memory table is created, and then 
   the serde is set. 
2. Line 7: A table object is created from the `TableDescriptor`; internally, 
   the `TableDescriptor` is converted to a `TableSpec`, and registered with the 
   `TaskApplicationDescriptor`. The table object has a reference to the `TableSpec`.
3. Line 9: creates an `InputStream`
4. Line 10: applies a map operator defined in line 16-28, all table instances 
   can be accessed from the task context in `Task.init()`. In this example, 
   it is stored in a local variable.
5. Line 11: joins the mapped stream with the table using the supplied join 
   function defined in lines 30-39.
6. Line 12: writes the join result stream to another table

# Using Table with Samza Low Level API

The code snippet below illustrates the usage of table in Samza low level API.

{% highlight java %}
 1  class SamzaTaskApplication implements TaskApplication {
 2  
 3  @Override
 4  public void describe(TaskApplicationDescriptor appDesc) {
 5    DelegatingSystemDescriptor ksd = new DelegatingSystemDescriptor("mySystem");
 6 
 7    TableDescriptor<Integer, Profile> tableDesc = new InMemoryTableDescriptor(
 8        "T1", KVSerde.of(new IntegerSerde(), new ProfileJsonSerde()));
 9    GenericInputDescriptor<Profile> profileISD = ksd.getInputDescriptor("Profile", new NoOpSerde<>());
10 
11   appDesc.addTable(tableDesc); 
12   appDesc.addInputStream(profileISD);  
13 }
14
15
16  public class MyStreamTask implements StreamTask, InitableTask {
17    private ReadWriteTable<Integer, Profile> profileTable;
18 
19    @Override
20    public void init(Config config, TaskContext context) {
21      profileTable = (ReadWriteTable<Integer, Profile>) context.getTable("t1");
22    }
23 
24    @Override
25    public void process(IncomingMessageEnvelope envelope, MessageCollector collector, TaskCoordinator coordinator) {
26      String key = (String)message.getKey();
27      Profile profile = (Profile)message.getMessage();
28      profileTable.put(key, profile);
29    }
30  }
{% endhighlight %}

In the code snippet above, we read from an input stream, perform transformation, 
join with a table and finally write the output to another table.

1. Line 7-8: A `TableDescriptor` for an in-memory table is created with tableId “t1”, 
     and then the serde is set. 
2. Line 9: creates an `InputStreamDescriptor`.
3. Line 11-12: adds `TableDescriptor` and `InputStreamDescriptor` to the `TaskApplicationDescriptor`.
4. Line 16: `InitiableStreamTask` is implemented.
5. Line 21: A reference to table “t1” is obtained in the `Task.init()` method.
6. Line 26-28: gets the profile key and record from the incoming stream and writes to the table. 

[`ReadableTable`] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-api/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/table/ReadableTable.java) 
or [`ReadWriteTable`] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-api/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/table/ReadWriteTable.java) 
can be used in the 
[`StreamTask.process()`] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-api/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/task/StreamTask.java#L49) 
method on the table reference obtained 
in the 
[`InitableTask.init()`] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-api/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/task/InitableTask.java#L35) 
method.

# Table Types

## Remote Table

[`RemoteTable`](https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-core/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/table/remote/RemoteTableDescriptor.java) 
provides a unified abstraction for Samza applications to access any remote data 
store through stream-table join in high-level API or direct access in low-level 
API. Remote Table is a store-agnostic abstraction that can be customized to 
access new types of stores by writing pluggable I/O "Read/Write" functions, 
implementations of 
[`TableReadFunction`](https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-core/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/table/remote/TableReadFunction.java) and 
[`TableWriteFunction`](https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-core/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/table/remote/TableWriteFunction.java) 
interfaces. Remote Table also provides common functionality, eg. rate limiting 
(built-in) and caching (hybrid).

The async APIs in Remote Table are recommended over the sync versions for higher 
throughput. They can be used with Samza with low-level API to achieve the maximum 
throughput. 

Remote Tables are represented by class 
[`RemoteReadableTable`](https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-core/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/table/remote/RemoteReadableTable.java) and 
[`RemoteReadWriteTable`](https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-core/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/table/remote/RemoteReadWriteTable.java). 
All configuration options of a Remote Table can be found in the 
[`RemoteTableDescriptor`](https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-core/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/table/remote/RemoteTableDescriptor.java) class. 

### Rate Limiting

Remote Table has built-in client-side rate limiting support in both of its sync 
and async executions. This is useful when a remote data store does not have 
server-side rate limiting or is not sophisticated enough to handle heavy 
inbound requests. 

#### Configuration

Rate limiting can be enabled with [`RemoteTableDescriptor`](https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-core/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/table/remote/RemoteTableDescriptor.java) in two ways:
 
1. Default: `withReadRateLimit()` and `withWriteRateLimit()`. The 
   [default implementation](https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-core/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/util/EmbeddedTaggedRateLimiter.java)
   uses [Guava](https://google.github.io/guava/releases/snapshot-jre/api/docs/com/google/common/util/concurrent/RateLimiter.html)
   for rate limiting and provides basic throttling on read/write rates.
2. User-defined instance: `withRateLimiter()`. Tailored for more advanced 
   usages, eg. custom policies and/or rate limiter libraries

#### Quota

For the default rate limiter, a per-container quota needs to be specified, and 
is divided evenly among all task instances. Application developers are expected 
to calculate such quota from a global quota against the number of containers.

### Retry

I/O failures are not uncommon given the inherently unreliable network and complex 
behaviors of distributed data stores. To be fault-tolerant, Remote Table provides 
built-in support for retrying failed I/O operations originated from the data store 
clients.

Retry capability can be added to a [`RemoteTableDescriptor`](https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-core/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/table/remote/RemoteTableDescriptor.java) by providing a 
[`TableRetryPolicy`] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-core/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/table/retry/TableRetryPolicy.java),
 which consists of three aspects: 

* Backoff/Sleep policy - fixed, random, exponential with jitters
* Termination policy - by total attempts and/or delay
* Retriable exception classification - predicate on `Throwable`

By default, retry is disabled as such failed I/O operations will propagate up and 
the caller is expected to handle the exception. When enabled, retry is on a 
per-request basis such that each individual request is retried independently. 

Lastly, Remote Table retry provides a set of standard metrics for monitoring. 
They can be found in 
[`RetryMetrics`] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-core/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/table/retry/RetryMetrics.java).

## Local Table

A table is considered local when its data physically co-exists on the same host 
machine as its running job, e.g. in memory or on disk. Local tables are particularly 
useful when data needs to be accessed frequently with low latency, such as a cache. 
Samza Table API supports in-memory and RocksDB-based local tables, which are based 
on the current implementation of in-memory and RocksDB stores. Both tables provide 
feature parity to existing in-memory and RocksDB-based stores. For more detailed 
information please refer to 
[`RocksDbTableDescriptor`] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-kv-rocksdb/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/storage/kv/RocksDbTableDescriptor.java) and 
[`InMemoryTableDescriptor`] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-kv-inmemory/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/storage/kv/inmemory/InMemoryTableDescriptor.java). 

## Hybrid Table

Hybrid Table consists of one or more tables, and it orchestrates operations between 
them to achieve more advanced functionality. Caching support for remote table is 
currently built on top of hybrid Table because cache can be naturally abstracted 
as a table, eg. local table is also a durable cache.

### Caching

Despite the convenience of remote table, it still incurs the same latency as accessing 
the remote store directly. Whenever eventual consistency is acceptable, Samza 
applications can leverage the caching support in Table API to reduce such latency 
in addition to using the async methods. 

[`CachingTable`] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-core/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/table/caching/CachingTable.java) 
is the generic table type for combining a cache table (Guava, RocksDb, Couchbase) 
with a remote table. Both the cache and data tables are pluggable, and `CachingTable`
handles the interactions between them for caching semantics.

#### Write Policies

Caching Table supports below write policies and you can configure them with 
[`CachingTableDescriptor`] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-core/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/table/caching/CachingTableDescriptor.java). 

* Write-through: records are written to both the data store and cache
* Write-around: records are written only to data store bypassing the cache
   * Useful when read-path has no locality with read-path

#### Synchronization

No synchronization is done between data store and cache in `CachingTable` because 
it is very cumbersome in the async code paths. Given eventual consistency is a 
presumed trade-off for enabling caching, it should be acceptable for the table 
and cache to not always be in-sync. Last but not least, unsynchronized operations 
in `CachingTable` deliver much higher throughput.

#### Configuration

Similar to 
[`RateLimiter`](https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-api/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/util/RateLimiter.java)
configuration in remote table, caching can be configured in two ways: 

1. Default: `withCacheSize()`, `withReadTtl()`, `withWriteTtl()`
2. Custom `CacheTable` instance: `withCache()`

The default 
[`CacheTable`] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-core/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/table/caching/guava/GuavaCacheTable.java) 
is an in-memory cache implemented on top of 
[Guava Cache] (https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/CachesExplained). 

# Implementing Your Own Tables

## More Concepts

[`TableSpec`] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-api/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/table/TableSpec.java) 
- Internal representation of a table, containing all information about a table.

[`TableProvider`] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-api/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/table/TableProvider.java) 
- Provides the underlying table implementation that conforms to Table API.

[`TableManager`] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-core/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/table/TableManager.java) 
- Responsible for lifecycle of all table instances within a task; it is 
created during instantiation of Samza container.

## Lifecycle of a Table

The life of a table goes through a few phases

1. **Declaration** - at first one declares the table by creating a `TableDescriptor`. In both 
   Samza high level and low level API, the `TableDescriptor` is registered with stream 
   graph, internally converted to `TableSpec` and in return a reference to a `Table` 
   object is obtained that can participate in the building of the DAG.
2. **Instantiation** - during planning stage, configuration is 
   [generated] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-core/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/execution/JobNode.java) 
   from `TableSpec`, 
   and the actual tables are instantiated during initialization of 
   [Samza container] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-core/src/main/scala/org/apache/samza/container/SamzaContainer.scala).
3. **Usage** - there are a few ways to access a table instance
   * In Samza high level API, a reference to Table can be obtained from a `TableDescriptor`, 
     which can be used to participate in the DAG operations such as 
     [`join()`] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-api/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/operators/MessageStream.java) and 
     [`sendTo()`] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-api/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/operators/MessageStream.java)
   * In Samza high level API, all table instances can be retrieved from `TaskContext` using 
     table-id during initialization of a 
     [`InitableFunction`] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-api/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/operators/functions/InitableFunction.java).
   * In Samza low level API, all table instances can be retrieved from `TaskContext` using 
     table-id during initialization of a 
   [`InitableTask`] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-api/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/task/InitableTask.java).
4. **Cleanup** - 
   [`close()`] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-api/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/table/ReadableTable.java) 
   is invoked on all tables when a job is stopped.

## Developing a Local Table

Developing a local table involves implementing a new table descriptor, provider and provider factory.

1. [`TableDescriptor`] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-api/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/operators/TableDescriptor.java) - this is the user facing object that contains primarily configuration parameters. 
   In addition, a few internal methods need to be implemented
   * `generateTableSpecConfig()` should convert parameters in the table descriptor 
     to a `Map<String, String>`, so that information about a table can be transferred 
     to a `TableSpec`.
   * `getTableSpec()` creates a `TableSpec` object, which is the internal representation 
     of a table.
2. [`TableProvider`] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-api/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/table/TableProvider.java) - provides the implementation for a table. It ensures a table is
   properly constructed and also manages its lifecycle. Methods to implement are
   * `generateConfig()` generates all Samza configuration relevant to the table. 
     Note in the case of RocksDB, store configuration is also generated here.

Note:

* Since the current local table implementation relies on Samza store implementation, 
  adding a local table requires providing the store implementation first.

## Developing a Remote Table

The generic design of remote table abstracts away mach common functionality. 
Therefore, adding a new remote table type is much more straightforward than 
writing a Samza table from scratch. You only need to implement the 
[`TableReadFunction`](https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-core/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/table/remote/TableReadFunction.java) and
[`TableWriteFunction`](https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-core/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/table/remote/TableWriteFunction.java) 
(if supported) interfaces, and the new table type is readily usable with the 
Remote Table framework.

![diagram-medium](/img/{{site.version}}/learn/documentation/api/table-descriptor-class-diagram.svg)

Since the interfaces have sufficient javadocs and are self-explanatory, we present a 
high-level guideline to call out some less obvious aspects and help ensure consistency 
among future I/O (Read/Write) function implementations in the following sections. 

### Serializability

Samza Remote Table I/O function interfaces extend `java.io.Serializable`, which imposes 
a serializability expectation on their implementations, i.e.

1. All fields within I/O function classes must be serializable.
2. Non-serializable fields must be marked transient. Otherwise, serialization 
   of I/O function will fail. Typical examples of such fields are store client 
   objects.
3. Consequently, non-serializable fields must be initialized within the 
   implementation of the init() method of the InitableFunction interface extended 
   by both TableReadFunction and TableWriteFunction interfaces. Otherwise, 
   non-serializable fields will be null after I/O function is deserialized.

{% highlight java %}
class ReadFunction implements TableReadFunction {
  @Override
  public void init(Config config, TaskContext context) {
    /* Initialize all transient fields here. */
  }
}
 
class WriteFunction implements TableWriteFunction {
  @Override
  public void init(Config config, TaskContext context) {
    /* Initialize all transient fields here. */
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Logging

Our recommendation is to:

1. Avoid doing any informational logging in I/O functions that are typically 
   invoked extensively in Samza applications, e.g.
   * `TableReadFunction.get[All]()`
   * `TableWriteFunction.put[All]()`
   * `TableWriteFunction.delete[All]()`
2. Log all initialization-related successes/failures occurring in overrides of 
`InitableFunction.init()` to improve diagnosability.

### Handling Client Exceptions and Retrying Failed Requests

Implementations of I/O functions for remote stores are likely to utilize a 
client object for communicating with their corresponding store endpoints. 
In this setup, it is possible for an I/O function to run into situations 
where the client it uses throws, e.g. in response to networking or logical 
errors.

We recommend:

1. Catching all such errors, wrapping and throwing them in a 
[`SamzaException`] (https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-api/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/SamzaException.java).
2. Attempting no retry in the face of client errors or failed requests. The 
   intent of the current design of Samza Remote Table API is to handle 
   retries at a higher and more abstract Remote Table level, which implies 
   retrying is not a responsibility of I/O functions.

### Caching

Samza Remote Table API can be configured to utilize user-supplied caches. 
You may refer to the [Caching](#caching) section under Hybrid Table for more details.

### Rate Limiting
Samza Remote Table API offers generic rate limiting capabilities that can 
be used with all I/O function implementations. You may refer to the 
[Rate Limiting](#rate-limiting) section under Remote Table for more details.

### Separate vs Combined Read/Write Implementations

It is up to the developer whether to implement both `TableReadFunction` and 
`TableWriteFunction` in one class or two separate classes. Defining them in 
separate classes can be cleaner if their implementations are elaborate and 
extended, whereas keeping them in a single class may be more practical if 
they share a considerable amount of code or are relatively short.
