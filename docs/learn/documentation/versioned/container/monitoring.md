# Monitoring Samza Applications

This section provides details on monitoring of Samza jobs, not to be confused with _Samza Monitors_ (components of the Samza-REST service that provide cluster-wide monitoring capabilities).



Like any other production software, it is critical to monitor the health of our Samza jobs. Samza relies on metrics for monitoring and includes an extensible metrics library. While a few standard metrics are provided out-of-the-box, it is easy to define metrics specific to your application.

## A. Metrics Reporters

Samza&#39;s metrics library encapsulates the metrics collection and sampling logic. Metrics Reporters in Samza are responsible for emitting metrics to external services which may archive, process, visualize the metrics&#39; values, or trigger alerts based on them.

Samza includes default implementations for two such Metrics Reporters:

1. a) A _JMXReporter_ (detailed [below](#jmxreporter)) which allows using standard JMX clients for probing containers to retrieve metrics encoded as JMX MBeans. Visualization tools such as [Grafana](https://grafana.com/dashboards/3457) could also be used to visualize this JMX data.

1. b) A _MetricsSnapshot_ reporter (detailed [below](#snapshotreporter)) which allows periodically publishing all metrics to Kafka. A downstream Samza job could then consume and publish these metrics to other metrics management systems such as [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Graphite](https://graphiteapp.org/).

Note that Samza allows multiple Metrics Reporters to be used simultaneously.


### <a name="jmxreporter"></a> A.1 Reporting Metrics to JMX (JMX Reporter)

This reporter encodes all its internal and user-defined metrics as JMX MBeans and hosts a JMX MBean server. Standard JMX clients (such as JConsole, VisualVM) can thus be used to probe Samza&#39;s containers and YARN-ApplicationMaster to retrieve these metrics&#39; values. JMX also provides additional profiling capabilities (e.g., for CPU and memory utilization), which are also enabled by this reporter.

#### <a name="enablejmxreporter"></a> Enabling the JMX Reporter
JMXReporter can be enabled by adding the following configuration.

```
#Define a Samza metrics reporter called "jxm", which publishes to JMX
metrics.reporter.jmx.class=org.apache.samza.metrics.reporter.JmxReporterFactory

# Use the jmx reporter (if using multiple reporters, separate them with commas)
metrics.reporters=jmx

```

#### <a name="usejmxreporter"></a> Using the JMX Reporter

To connect to the JMX MBean server, first obtain the JMX Server URL and port, published in the container logs:


```

2018-08-14 11:30:49.888 [main] JmxServer [INFO] Started JmxServer registry port=54661 server port=54662 url=service:jmx:rmi://localhost:54662/jndi/rmi://localhost:54661/jmxrmi

```


If using the **JConsole** JMX client, launch it with the service URL as:

```
jconsole service:jmx:rmi://localhost:54662/jndi/rmi://localhost:54661/jmxrmi
```

<img src="/img/versioned/learn/documentation/container/jconsole.png" alt="JConsole" class="diagram-large">

 

If using the VisualVM JMX client, run:

```
jvisualvm
```

After **VisualVM** starts, click the &quot;Add JMX Connection&quot; button and paste in your JMX server URL (obtained from the logs).
Install the VisualVM-MBeans plugin (Tools->Plugin) to view the metrics MBeans.

<img src="/img/versioned/learn/documentation/container/visualvm.png" alt="VisualVM" class="diagram-small">

 
###  <a name="snapshotreporter"></a> A.2 Reporting Metrics to Kafka (MetricsSnapshot Reporter)

This reporter publishes metrics to Kafka.

#### <a name="enablesnapshotreporter"></a> Enabling the MetricsSnapshot Reporter
To enable this reporter, simply append the following to your job&#39;s configuration.

```
#Define a metrics reporter called "snapshot"
metrics.reporters=snapshot
metrics.reporter.snapshot.class=org.apache.samza.metrics.reporter.MetricsSnapshotReporterFactory
```


Specify the kafka topic to which the reporter should publish to

```
metrics.reporter.snapshot.stream=kafka.metrics
```


Specify the serializer to be used for the metrics data

```
serializers.registry.metrics.class=org.apache.samza.serializers.MetricsSnapshotSerdeFactory
systems.kafka.streams.metrics.samza.msg.serde=metrics
```
With this configuration, all containers (including the YARN-ApplicationMaster) will publish their JSON-encoded metrics 
to a Kafka topic called &quot;metrics&quot; every 60 seconds.
The following is an example of such a metrics message:

```
{
  "header": {
    "container-name": "samza-container-0",

    "exec-env-container-id": "YARN-generated containerID",
    "host": "samza-grid-1234.example.com",
    "job-id": "1",
    "job-name": "my-samza-job",
    "reset-time": 1401729000347,
    "samza-version": "0.0.1",
    "source": "TaskName-Partition1",
    "time": 1401729420566,
    "version": "0.0.1"
  },
  "metrics": {
    "org.apache.samza.container.TaskInstanceMetrics": {
      "commit-calls": 1,
      "window-calls": 0,
      "process-calls": 14,

      "messages-actually-processed": 14,
      "send-calls": 0,

      "flush-calls": 1,
      "pending-messages": 0,
      "messages-in-flight": 0,
      "async-callback-complete-calls": 14,
        "wikipedia-#en.wikipedia-0-offset": 8979,
    }
  }
}
```


Each message contains a header which includes information about the job, time, and container from which the metrics were obtained. 
The remainder of the message contains the metric values, grouped by their types, such as TaskInstanceMetrics, SamzaContainerMetrics,  KeyValueStoreMetrics, JVMMetrics, etc. Detailed descriptions of the various metric categories and metrics are available [here](#metricssheet).

It is possible to configure the MetricsSnapshot reporter to use a different serializer using this configuration

```
serializers.registry.metrics.class=<classpath-to-my-custom-serializer-factory>
```



To configure the reporter to publish with a different frequency (default 60 seconds), add the following to your job&#39;s configuration

```
metrics.reporter.snapshot.interval=<publish frequency in seconds>
```

Similarly, to limit the set of metrics emitted you can use the regex based blacklist supported by this reporter. For example, to limit it to publishing only SamzaContainerMetrics use:

```
metrics.reporter.snapshot.blacklist=^(?!.\*?(?:SamzaContainerMetrics)).\*$
```


### <a name="customreporter"></a> A.3 Creating a Custom MetricsReporter

Creating a custom MetricsReporter entails implementing the MetricsReporter interface. The lifecycle of Metrics Reporters is managed by Samza and is aligned with the Samza container lifecycle. Metrics Reporters can poll metric values and can receive callbacks when new metrics are added at runtime, e.g., user-defined metrics. Metrics Reporters are responsible for maintaining executor pools, IO connections, and any in-memory state that they require in order to export metrics to the desired external system, and managing the lifecycles of such components.

After implementation, a custom reporter can be enabled by appending the following to the Samza job&#39;s configuration:

```
#Define a metrics reporter with a desired name
metrics.reporter.<my-custom-reporter-name>.class=<classpath-of-my-custom-reporter-factory>


#Enable its use for metrics reporting
metrics.reporters=<my-custom-reporter-name>
```



## <a name="metrictypes"></a> B. Metric Types in Samza 

Metrics in Samza are divided into three types -- _Gauges_, _Counters_, and _Timers_.

_Gauges_ are useful when measuring the magnitude of a certain system property, e.g., the current queue length, or a buffer size.

_Counters_ are useful in measuring metrics that are cumulative values, e.g., the number of messages processed since container startup. Certain counters are also useful when visualized with their rate-of-change, e.g., the rate of message processing.

_Timers_ are useful for storing and reporting a sliding-window of timing values. Samza also supports a ListGauge type metric, which can be used to store and report a list of any primitive-type such as strings.

## <a name="userdefinedmetrics"></a> C. Adding User-Defined Metrics


To add a new metric, you can simply use the _MetricsRegistry_ in the provided TaskContext of 
the init() method to register new metrics. The code snippets below show examples of registering and updating a user-defined
 Counter metric. Timers and gauges can similarly be used from within your task class.

### <a name="lowlevelapi"></a> Low-level API

Simply have your task implement the InitableTask interface and access the MetricsRegistry from the TaskContext.

```
public class MyJavaStreamTask implements StreamTask, InitableTask {

  private Counter messageCount;
  public void init(Config config, TaskContext context) {
    this.messageCount = context.getMetricsRegistry().newCounter(getClass().getName(), "message-count");

  }

  public void process(IncomingMessageEnvelope envelope, MessageCollector collector, TaskCoordinator coordinator) {
    messageCount.inc();
  }

}
```

### <a name="highlevelapi"></a> High-Level API

In the high-level API, you can define a ContextManager and access the MetricsRegistry from the TaskContext, using which you can add and update your metrics.

```
public class MyJavaStreamApp implements StreamApplication {

  private Counter messageCount = null;

  @Override
  public void init(StreamGraph graph, Config config) {
    graph.withContextManager(new DemoContextManager());
    MessageStream<IndexedRecord> viewEvent = ...;
    viewEvent
        .map(this::countMessage)
        ...;
  }

  public final class DemoContextManager implements ContextManager {

  @Override
  public void init(Config config, TaskContext context) {
      messageCount = context.getMetricsRegistry().
      newCounter(getClass().getName(), "message-count");
  }

  private IndexedRecord countMessage(IndexedRecord value) {
    messageCount.inc();
    return value;
  }

  @Override
  public void close() { }

  }
```

## <a name="keyinternalsamzametrics"></a> D. Key Internal Samza Metrics

Samza&#39;s internal metrics allow for detailed monitoring of a Samza job and all its components. Detailed descriptions 
of all internal metrics are listed in a reference sheet [here](#e-metrics-reference-sheet). 
However, a small subset of internal metrics facilitates easy high-level monitoring of a job.

These key metrics can be grouped into three categories: _Vital metrics_, _Store__metrics_, and _Operator metrics_. 
We explain each of these categories in detail below.

### <a name="vitalmetrics"></a> D.1. Vital Metrics

These metrics indicate the vital signs of a Samza job&#39;s health. Note that these metrics are categorized into different groups based on the Samza component they are emitted by, (e.g. SamzaContainerMetrics, TaskInstanceMetrics, ApplicationMaster metrics, etc).

| **Metric Name** | **Group** | **Meaning** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Availability -- Are there any resource failures impacting my job?** |
| job-healthy | ContainerProcessManagerMetrics | A binary value, where 1 indicates that all the required containers configured for a job are running, 0 otherwise. |
| failed-containers | ContainerProcessManagerMetrics  | Number of containers that have failed in the job&#39;s lifetime |
| **Input Processing Lag -- Is my job lagging ?** |
| \<Topic\>-\<Partition\>-messages-behind-high-watermark |
KafkaSystemConsumerMetrics | Number of input messages waiting to be processed on an input topic-partition |
| consumptionLagMs | EventHubSystemConsumer | Time difference between the processing and enqueuing (into EventHub)  of input events |
| millisBehindLatest | KinesisSystemConsumerMetrics | Current processing lag measured from the tip of the stream, expressed in milliseconds. |
| **Output/Produce Errors -- Is my job failing to produce output?** |
| producer-send-failed | KafkaSystemProducerMetrics | Number of send requests to Kafka (e.g., output topics) that failed due to unrecoverable errors |
| flush-failed | HdfsSystemProducerMetrics | Number of failed flushes to HDFS |
| **Processing Time -- Is my job spending too much time processing inputs?** |
| process-ns | SamzaContainerMetrics | Amount of time the job is spending in processing each input |
| commit-ns | SamzaContainerMetrics | Amount of time the job is spending in checkpointing inputs (and flushing producers, checkpointing KV stores, flushing side input stores).
The frequency of this function is configured using _task.commit.ms_ |
| window-ns | SamzaContainerMetrics | In case of WindowableTasks being used, amount of time the job is spending in its window() operations |

### <a name="storemetrics"></a>  D.2. Store Metrics

Stateful Samza jobs typically use RocksDB backed KV stores for storing state. Therefore, timing metrics associated with 
KV stores can be useful for monitoring input lag. These are some key metrics for KV stores. 
The metrics reference sheet [here](#e-metrics-reference-sheet) details all metrics for KV stores.



| **Metric name** | **Group** | **Meaning** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| get-ns, put-ns, delete-ns, all-ns | KeyValueStorageEngineMetrics | Time spent performing respective KV store operations |



### <a name="operatormetrics"></a>  D.3. Operator Metrics

If your Samza job uses Samza&#39;s Fluent API or Samza-SQL, Samza creates a DAG (directed acyclic graph) of 
_operators_ to form the required data processing pipeline. In such cases, operator metrics allow fine-grained 
monitoring of such operators. Key operator metrics are listed below, while a detailed list is present 
in the metrics reference sheet.

| **Metric name** | **Group** | **Meaning** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <Operator-ID\>-handle-message-ns | WindowOperatorImpl, PartialJoinOperatorImpl, StreamOperatorImpl, StreamTableJoinOperatorImpl, etc | Time spent handling a given input message by the operator |



## <a name="metricssheet"></a>  E. Metrics Reference Sheet
Suffixes &quot;-ms&quot; and &quot;-ns&quot; to metric names indicated milliseconds and nanoseconds respectively. All &quot;average time&quot; metrics are calculated over a sliding time window of 300 seconds.

All \<system\>, \<stream\>, \<partition\>, \<store-name\>, \<topic\>, are populated with the corresponding actual values at runtime.
