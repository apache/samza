                        A factory class that is used to determine how input SystemStreamPartitions are grouped together for processing in individual StreamTask instances. The factory must implement the SystemStreamPartitionGrouperFactory interface. Once this configuration is set, it can't be changed, since doing so could violate state semantics, and lead to a loss of data.

                          <dd>Groups input stream partitions according to their partition number. This grouping leads to a single StreamTask processing all messages for a single partition (e.g. partition 0) across all input streams that have a partition 0. Therefore, the default is that you get one StreamTask for all input partitions with the same partition number. Using this strategy, if two input streams have a partition 0, then messages from both partitions will be routed to a single StreamTask. This partitioning strategy is useful for joining and aggregating streams.</dt>

                        To enable <a href="../container/checkpointing.html">checkpointing</a>, you must set
                        this property to the fully-qualified name of a Java class that implements
                        <a href="../api/javadocs/org/apache/samza/checkpoint/CheckpointManagerFactory.html">CheckpointManagerFactory</a>.
                        This is not required, but recommended for most jobs. If you don't configure checkpointing,
                        and a job or container restarts, it does not remember which messages it has already processed.
                        Without checkpointing, consumer behavior is determined by the
                        <a href="#systems-samza-offset-default" class="property">...samza.offset.default</a>
                        setting, which by default skips any messages that were published while the container was
                        restarting. Checkpointing allows a job to start up where it previously left off.
                        Samza ships with two checkpoint managers by default:
                        <dl>
                            <dt><code>org.apache.samza.checkpoint.file.FileSystemCheckpointManagerFactory</code></dt>
                            <dd>Writes checkpoints to files on the local filesystem. You can configure the file path
                                with the <a href="#task-checkpoint-path" class="property">task.checkpoint.path</a>
                                property. This is a simple option if your job always runs on the same machine.
                                On a multi-machine cluster, this would require a network filesystem mount.</dd>
                            <dt><code>org.apache.samza.checkpoint.kafka.KafkaCheckpointManagerFactory</code></dt>
                            <dd>Writes checkpoints to a dedicated topic on a Kafka cluster. This is the recommended
                                option if you are already using Kafka for input or output streams. Use the

                        the time between checkpoints, in milliseconds. The frequency of checkpointing affects
                        failure recovery: if a container fails unexpectedly (e.g. due to crash or machine failure)
                        and is restarted, it resumes processing at the last checkpoint. Any messages processed
                        since the last checkpoint on the failed container are processed again. Checkpointing
                        more frequently reduces the number of messages that may be processed twice, but also
                        uses more resources.

                        ultimately fails. Failing the container is a safety precaution to ensure the latest checkpoints
                        only reflect the events that  have been completely and successfully processed. However, some

                        one or many (in the case of batching producers) dropped messages. If you enable this, it is highly
                        recommended that you also configure alerting on the 'producer-send-failed' metric, since the

                      Samza's container polls for more messages under two conditions. The first condition arises when there are simply no remaining
                      buffered messages to process for any input SystemStreamPartition. The second condition arises when some input
                      SystemStreamPartitions have empty buffers, but some do not. In the latter case, a polling interval is defined to determine how
                      often to refresh the empty SystemStreamPartition buffers. By default, this interval is 50ms, which means that any empty
                      SystemStreamPartition buffer will be refreshed at least every 50ms. A higher value here means that empty SystemStreamPartitions
                      will be refreshed less often, which means more latency is introduced, but less CPU and network will be used. Decreasing this
                      value means that empty SystemStreamPartitions are refreshed more frequently, thereby introducing less latency, but increasing
                      CPU and network utilization.

                        for incoming messages in order to increase throughput (the stream task can continue
                        processing buffered messages while new messages are fetched from Kafka). This
                        parameter determines the number of messages we aim to buffer across all stream
                        partitions consumed by a container. For example, if a container consumes 50 partitions,
                        it will try to buffer 1000 messages per partition by default. When the number of
                        buffered messages falls below that threshold, Samza fetches more messages from the
                        Kafka broker to replenish the buffer. Increasing this parameter can increase a job's
                        processing throughput, but also increases the amount of memory used.

                        When consuming streams from Kafka, a Samza container maintains an in-memory buffer
                        for incoming messages in order to increase throughput (the stream task can continue
                        processing buffered messages while new messages are fetched from Kafka). This
                        parameter determines the total size of messages we aim to buffer across all stream
                        partitions consumed by a container based on bytes. Defines how many bytes to use for the buffered
                        prefetch messages for job as a whole. The bytes for a single system/stream/partition are computed based on this.
                        This fetches the entire messages, hence this bytes limit is a soft one, and the actual usage can be the bytes
                        limit + size of max message in the partition for a given stream. If the value of this property is > 0
                        then this takes precedence over systems.<span class="system">system-name</span>.samza.fetch.threshold.<br>
                        For example, if fetchThresholdBytes is set to 100000 bytes, and there are 50 SystemStreamPartitions registered,
                        then the per-partition threshold is (100000 / 2) / 50 = 1000 bytes. As this is a soft limit, the actual usage
                        can be 1000 bytes + size of max message. As soon as a SystemStreamPartition's buffered messages bytes drops
                        below 1000, a fetch request will be executed to get more data for it.

                        Increasing this parameter will decrease the latency between when a queue is drained of messages and when new
                        messages are enqueued, but also leads to an increase in memory usage since more messages will be held in memory.

                        The default value is -1, which means this is not used.

The advanced partitioning goes beyond the basic assumption that each file is a partition. With advanced partitioning you can group files into partitions arbitrarily. For example, if you have a set of files as [part-01-a.avro, part-01-b.avro, part-02-a.avro, part-02-b.avro, part-03-a.avro], and you want to organize the partitions as (part-01-a.avro, part-01-b.avro), (part-02-a.avro, part-02-b.avro), (part-03-a.avro), where the numbers in the middle act as a "group identifier", you can then set this property to be "part-[id]-.*" (note that "[id]" is a reserved term here, i.e. you have to literally put it as "[id]"). The partitioner will apply this pattern to all file names and extract the "group identifier" ("[id]" in the pattern), then use the "group identifier" to group files into partitions.
