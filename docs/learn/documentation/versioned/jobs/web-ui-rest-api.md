### Dashboard

Samza's ApplicationMaster comes with a dashboard to show useful information such as:

1. Where containers are located.
2. Links to logs.
3. The Samza job's configuration.
4. Container failure count.

You can find this dashboard by going to your YARN grid's ResourceManager page (usually something like [http://localhost:8088/cluster](http://localhost:8088/cluster)), and clicking on the "ApplicationMaster" link of a running Samza job.

### REST API

REST API produces JSON and provides information about metrics, task context, config, containers and status.

<table class="table table-condensed table-bordered table-striped">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Endpoint</th>
      <th>Meaning</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>/metrics</td><td>HashMap that represents metrics for every 60 seconds.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/task-context</td><td>HashMap that provides information about task context including task name and task ID.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/am</td><td>HashMap that represents information about containers and status.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/config</td><td>HashMap that represents the config.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
