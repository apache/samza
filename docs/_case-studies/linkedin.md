LinkedIn is a professional networking company that offers various services and platform for job seekers, employers and sales professionals. With a growing user base and multiple product offerings, it becomes imperative to streamline and standardize our communications to the users. In order to ensure member experience comes first before individual product metrics, LinkedIn developed a new email and notifications platform called *Air Traffic Controller*.

ATC is an intelligent platform, that is capable of tracking all the outgoing communications to the user and delivering the communication through the right channel to the right member at the right time.

It has a three main components,

- **Partitioner**: Partition communication requests, metrics based on user
- **Pipeline**: Handle partitioned communication requests which performs aggregation and consults with the relevance model to determine delivery time
- **Relevance processor**: Provide insights on how relevant is the content to the user, the right delivery time, etc.

ATC, leverages Samza extensively and uses a lot of features including but not limited to:

- **Stateful processing**: The ML models in the relevance module are stored locally in RocksDb which are updated realtime time based on user feedback.
- **Async APIs and Multi-threading**: Samzaâ€™s multi-threading and Async APIs allows ATC to perform remote calls with high-throughput. This helps bring down the 90th percentile (P90) end-to-end latency for end to end latency for push notifications from about 12 seconds to about 1.5 seconds.
- **Host affinity**: Co-location of local state stores along with host awareness helps ATC to achieve zero downtime and instant recovery.

Key Samza Features: *Stateful processing*, *Async API*, *Host affinity*
