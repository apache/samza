Low Latency Web Scale Fraud Prevention

<!--more-->

eBay Enterprise is the worldâ€™s largest omni-channel commerce provider with 
hundreds millions of units shipped annually, as commerce gets more 
convenient and complex, so does fraud. The engineering team at eBay 
Enterprise selected Samza as the platform to build the horizontally 
scalable, realtime (sub-seconds) and fault tolerant abnormality detection 
system. For example, the system computes and evaluates key metrics to 
detect abnormal behaviors

-   Transaction velocity (#tnx/day) and change (#tnx/day vs #tnx/day over n days)
-   Amount velocity ($tnx/day) and change ($tnx/day vs $tnx/day over n days)

A wide range of realtime and historical adjunct data from various sources 
including people, places, interests, social and connections are ingested 
through Kafka, and stored in local RocksDB state store with changelog 
enabled for recovery. Incoming transaction data is aggregated using 
windowing and then joined with adjunct data stores in multiple stages. 
The system generates potential fraud cases for review real time. Finally, 
the engineering team at eBay Enterprise has built an OpenTSDB and Grafana 
based monitoring system using metrics collected through JMX.

Key Samza features: *Stateful processing*, *Windowing*, *Kafka-integration*,
*JMX-metrics*
