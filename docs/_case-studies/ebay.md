How Samza powers low-latency, web-scale fraud prevention at Ebay?

<!--more-->

eBay Enterprise is the worldâ€™s largest omni-channel commerce provider. The engineering team at eBay chose Apache Samza to build _PreCog_, their 
horizontally scalable anomaly detection system. 

_PreCog_ extensively leverages Samza's high-performance, fault-tolerant local storage. Its architecture had the following requirements, for which Samza perfectly fit the bill: <br/>

_Web-scale:_ Scale to a large number of users and large volume of data per-user. Additionally, should be possible to add more commodity hardware and scale horizontally. <br/>
_Low-latency:_ Process customer interactions real-time by reacting in milliseconds instead of hours. <br/>
_Fault-tolerance:_ Gracefully tolerate and handle hardware failures. <br/>

![diagram-large](/img/{{site.version}}/learn/documentation/case-study/ebay.png)

The PreCog anomaly-detection system comprises of multiple tiers, with each tier consisting of multiple Samza jobs, which process the output of the previous tier.

_Ingestion tier:_ In this tier, a variety of historical and realtime data from various
sources including people, places etc., is ingested into Kafka.

_Fanout tier:_ This tier consists of Samza jobs which process the Kafka events, fan them out and re-partition them based on various
facets like email-address, ip-address, credit-card number, shipping address etc. 

_Compute tier:_ The Samza jobs in this tier consume messages from the fan-out tier and compute various key metrics and derived features. Features used to evaluate fraud include: 

1. Number of transactions per-customer per-day <br/>
2. Change in the number of daily transactions over the past few days <br/>
3. Amount value ($$) of each transaction per-day <br/>
4. Change in the amount value of transactions over a sliding time-window <br/>
5. Number of transactions per shipping-address

_Assembly tier:_ This tier comprises of Samza jobs which join the output of the compute-tier with other additional data-sources
and make a final determination on transaction-fraud. 

For monitoring the _PreCog_ pipeline, EBay leverages Samza's [JMXMetricsReporter](/learn/documentation/{{site.version}}/operations/monitoring.html) and ingests the reported metrics into OpenTSDB/ HBase. The metrics are then 
visualzed using [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).


Key Samza features: *Stateful processing*, *Windowing*, *Kafka-integration*, *JMX-metrics*
