At <a class="external-link" href="https://www.intuit.com/" rel="nofollow">Intuit</a>, we use Samza to enrich events with more contextual data from various sources (CMDB, Change Management, Incident Management, Problem Management). This gives us more meaningful events that an operations centre person can act on.
