<a class="external-link" href="http://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-network-insight.html" rel="nofollow">vRealize Network Insight (vRNI)</a> is VMwareâ€™s flagship product for delivering intelligent operations for software defined network environments (e.g. NSX).
 
At the heart of the vRNI architecture are a set of distributed processing and analytics modules that crunch large amounts of streaming data on a cluster of multiple machines. It is critical that these operations are carried out in a way that is reliable, efficient and robust - even in the face of dynamic faults in the underlying infrastructure layers. We have been successfully using Apache Samza as a distributed streaming data processing framework for executing these analytical modules reliably and efficiently at a very large scale, thus helping us focus on our core business problems.
