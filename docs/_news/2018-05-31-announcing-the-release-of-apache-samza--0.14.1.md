Announcing the release of Apache Samza 0.14.1

We are very excited to announce the release of **Apache Samza 0.14.1**  
Samza has been powering real-time applications in production across several large companies (including LinkedIn, Netflix, Uber, Slack, Redfin, TripAdvisor, etc) for years now. Samza provides leading support for large-scale stateful stream processing with:

-   First class support for local state (with RocksDB store). This allows a stateful application to scale up to 1.1 Million events/sec on a single machine with SSD.
-   Support for incremental checkpointing of state instead of full snapshots. This enables Samza to scale to applications with very large state.
-   A fully pluggable model for input sources (e.g. Kafka, Kinesis, DynamoDB streams etc.) and output systems (HDFS, Kafka, ElastiCache etc.).
-   A fully asynchronous programming model that makes parallelizing remote calls efficient and effortless.
-   High level API for expressing complex stream processing pipelines in a few lines of code.
-   Flexible deployment model for running the the applications in any hosting environment and with cluster managers other than YARN.
-   Features like canaries, upgrades and rollbacks that support extremely large deployments with minimal downtime.

Overall, [51 JIRAs](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SAMZA/versions/12343155) were resolved in this release. A source download of the 0.14.1 release is available [here](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/samza/0.14.1). The release JARs are also available in Apache’s Maven repository. See Samza’s [download](http://samza.apache.org/startup/download/) page for details and Samza’s [feature preview](https://samza.apache.org/startup/preview/) for new features. We requires JDK version newer than 1.8.0_111 when running 0.14.1 release for users who are using Scala 2.12.

### Community Developments

In March 21th, we held the meetup for [Stream Processing with Apache Kafka & Apache Samza](https://www.meetup.com/Stream-Processing-Meetup-LinkedIn/events/248309045/), which has the following presentations for Samza:

-   [Conquering the Lambda architecture in LinkedIn metrics platform with Apache Calcite and Apache Samza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWInJ4USIU) ([Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/KhaiTran17/conquering-the-lambda-architecture-in-linkedin-metrics-platform-with-apache-calcite-and-apache-samza))
-   [Building Venice with Apache Kafka & Samza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Usz8E4S-hZE)

In industry, Samza got new adopters, including [Ntent](http://www.ntent.com) and [Movico](https://movio.co/en/).
