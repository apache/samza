We’re thrilled to announce to the release of Apache Samza 1.1.0.

Today Samza forms the backbone of hundreds of real-time production applications across a multitude of companies, such as LinkedIn, VMWare, Slack, Redfin among many others. Samza provides leading support for large-scale stateful stream processing with:

* First class support for local state (with RocksDB store). This allows a stateful application to scale up to 1.1 Million events/sec on a single machine with SSD.

* Support for incremental checkpointing of state instead of full snapshots. This enables Samza to scale to applications with very large state.

* A fully asynchronous programming model that makes parallelizing remote calls efficient and effortless.

* High level API for expressing complex stream processing pipelines in a few lines of code.

* Beam Samza Runner that marries Beam’s best in class support for EventTime based windowed processing and sophisticated triggering with Samza’s stable and scalable stateful processing model. 

* A fully pluggable model for input sources (e.g. Kafka, Kinesis, DynamoDB streams etc.) and output systems (HDFS, Kafka, ElastiCache etc.).

* A Table API that provides a common abstraction for accessing remote or local databases and allowing developers are able to "join" an input event stream with such a Table.

* Flexible deployment model for running the applications in any hosting environment and with cluster managers other than YARN.

* Features like canaries, upgrades and rollbacks that support extremely large deployments with minimal downtime.

###  **New Features, Upgrades and Bug Fixes:**
This release brings the following features, upgrades, and capabilities:
  * We have created a new Samza Stream 
  Processing [video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZDyxA22zzGyNgtBMUIXAgIaO5Ok3PR-x) 
   on Youtube
  * New and improved documentation, 
    code snippets, and examples for using the latest version of 
    Samza with Apache Beam (Code samples are here: [https://github.com/apache/samza-beam-examples](https://github.com/apache/samza-beam-examples))
