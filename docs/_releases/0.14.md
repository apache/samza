####Upgrade Notes
- Introduced a new mandatory configuration - `job.coordination.utils.factory`. It impacts applications using non-YARN deployment models. Read more about it [here](/learn/documentation/{{site.version}}/jobs/configuration-table.html).
- The following APIs in SystemAdmin have been deprecated in the previous versions and hence, replaced with newer APIs. If you have a custom System implementation, then you have to update to the newer APIs.
    - `void createChangelogStream(String streamName, int numOfPartitions); -> boolean createStream(StreamSpec streamSpec);`
    - `void createCoordinatorStream(String streamName); -> boolean createStream(StreamSpec streamSpec);`
    - `void validateChangelogStream(String streamName, int numOfPartitions); -> void validateStream(StreamSpec streamSpec) throws StreamValidationException;`
- New API has been added to SystemAdmin that clear a stream.
    - `boolean clearStream(StreamSpec streamSpec);` Read more about it in the [API docs](/learn/documentation/{{site.version}}/api/javadocs/org/apache/samza/system/SystemAdmin.html).
